                </div>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold mt-4 terms-head">1. Our Agreement With You</h5>

                <div className="mt-4">
                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">Products and Suppliers</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">We sell a variety of travel related products from different suppliers and service providers ("Suppliers"). Each Supplier has its own terms and condition that are applicable to your particular arrangements in addition to our general terms and conditions, and you should make sure you understand them. Certain software and content found on our website are owned or licensed by us or our Suppliers, your use of which may be subject to further conditions. Our website, which is referred throughout this Agreement, can be found at www.axistravel.com. <br></br>
AXIS Travel is acting as intermediary or a "Booking Agent" for products and services that are not directly supplied by us (e.g., air carriage and ground transportation, hotel accommodations, meals, tours, cruises, etc.). We are not a co-vendor of such products and services. You will be entering into a separate contract with such Suppliers in connection with such products and services. All airlines tickets are subject to supplemental price increases that may be imposed after the date of purchase. Post-purchase price increases may be applied due to additional costs imposed by a supplier or government. You may be charged additional sums by AXIS Travel to offset increased fees, fuel surcharges, taxes, and fluctuations in foreign exchange markets or any combination thereof. Acceptance of these terms and conditions hereby consent you to any post-purchase price increases and authorize AXIS Travel to charge my credit card for such additional amounts.</p>

                <div className="mt-4">
                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">Deposits and Payment</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">Any deposits from you are non-refundable. Payment of a deposit enables us to hold a reservation for you but does not guarantee the price. The price can only be guaranteed once we receive full payment and other travel documents have been issued, subject to any terms and conditions of the Supplier. We will advise you of the date that full payment is required. Upon your provision of your payment information, you are authorizing us to make the payment arrangements with the corresponding Suppliers. We reserve the right to refuse personal checks as a method of payment. After full payment, the conditions of the contract with your Supplier may permit them to increase the cost of your arrangements. If we are acting as your Booking Agent, we will pass on any such increase to you as we become aware of such increase. If we have arranged a package, changes in transportation costs including the cost of fuel, taxes, fees and exchange rates mean that the price of your travel arrangements may change after you have paid in full.</p>

                <p className="terms-note">Our general practice is to send documents to our customers electronically whenever possible. We reserve the rights to charge an administration fee should you make a request for such documents to be sent as a hard copy.</p>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">Cancellations and Changes</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">Your contract with your Suppliers may allow them to cancel or amend bookings. If we are your Booking Agent, we will ensure that you are promptly notified of any significant changes once we become aware of such change if there is time before your departure, but we accept no liability for any changes or costs incurred that may result. Subject to the Supplierâ€™s terms and conditions, you will then have the choice of accepting the change of arrangements, accepting an offer of alternative travel arrangements if one is made available by the Supplier, or canceling your booked arrangements and receiving any applicable refunds. We do not guaranty that any refunds will apply. If you have booked a flight and we are alerted to a significant schedule change by your airline before you leave the Dubai, U.A.E, we will contact you by email to advise you of this. Please ensure that you have given your contact email address to us and that you regularly check for messages before you leave. We have no control over airline schedule changes and accept no liability for costs which may arise as a result of such changes. After you have left the US, it is your responsibility to check with the airline that any onward flights you have confirmed are operating as booked. We strongly recommend that you contact your airline at least 72 hours before the scheduled departure of each flight to do this. Please note that for some airlines it is mandatory to confirm with them your intention to fly.</p>

                <div className="mt-4">
                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">Your Acceptance of these Terms and Conditions</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">By booking your arrangement with us or using our website, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including Parts 1-3 of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions of any Supplier that are applicable to your booking, travel arrangements or use of any website content. You agree on behalf of yourself and those you represent to comply with all such terms and conditions, including the payment of all amounts when due.

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">If You Change Your Booking</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">Where a change requested by you to your travel arrangements is permitted and possible, our standard service fees will apply in addition to any additional Supplier charges. Please contact your original booking agent to inquire about changes or review the â€˜Travel Helpâ€™ section of www.axistravel.com for details of how to request changes. Please note that all reservation changes are subject to availability and the terms and conditions of the product purchased. Changes to name details are not allowed by many airlines and other Suppliers. While we will endeavor make such a change if necessary, please bear in mind that most airlines and Suppliers treat a name change as a cancellation, to which standard conditions and charges would apply. Flights must be taken in the sequence they appear on your ticket or e-ticket confirmation. If you plan not to take a flight as booked, please contact the airline as far in advance as possible to discuss your options. If you do not check in on time for a confirmed reservation, the airline may register you as a â€˜no-showâ€™, which could result in extra charges and/or your whole flight itinerary being cancelled and/or render your ticket void.</p>

                <div className="mt-4">
                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">If You Cancel Your Booking</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">If you cancel your arrangements, you may be entitled to a partial refund. In addition to the cancellation terms and conditions of your Supplier(s), our standard fees will apply as may be outlined on your receipt or booking confirmation. We need to receive from you your original voucher before any applicable refund can be considered. If you decide to cancel arrangements before the balance due date, any deposits paid are non-refundable. Refunds will only be paid to you once we have received the funds back from the Supplier(s). Generally flight tickets cannot be refunded if they are partially used. We are not responsible for a Supplierâ€™s failure to pay a refund. If the reason for your cancellation is covered under the terms of your travel insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim your cancellation charges through your insurer.</p>

Check your ticket. If the status box shows "OK" for the flight in question, the airline policies typically require them to accommodate you on that flight, or if that is not possible, they must either find you a substitute flight or pay you denied boarding compensation. If necessary ask to speak to a supervisor.</p>
