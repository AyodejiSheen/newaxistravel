                <p className="terms-note">We have developed a privacy policy to keep you informed of what personally identifiable information ("PII") we may collect from you, what this information will be used for, with whom
such information will be shared, and the security procedures we have implemented to protect your privacy. PII includes information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as
name, address, phone number or email address.</p>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">To make travel arrangements and provide other services to you, we will collect personal information from you, including but not limited to:
your name, your mailing address, your phone number, email address, and travel preferences such as seat, special meals, and airline preferences;
information necessary to facilitate travel or other services, including travel companion(s)names, emergency contacts, seating preferences and special dietary or medical needs;
personal information provided to customer-service representatives to research and resolve issues or questions; and
payment information, including but not limited to your credit card number, card type, cardholder name, expiration date, and billing address.
We do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide personally identifiable information of any kind whatsoever. AXIS
Travel also uses commonly employed Internet technologies to collect additional information about users. For example, AXIS Travel uses "cookies" to determine how users reach the Web
site and to track general usage patterns once a user is on the Web site. This information is collected and analyzed in the aggregate in order to improve the function, content, overall
appearance, and capability of the Website. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a website and stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can always choose not to accept a cookie by changing your computer preferences to refuse cookies or to prompt you to
accept each cookie, but doing so will limit the range of features available to you on the Web site. Although AXIS Travel requires that your web browser accept cookies to access the Web
site, AXIS Travel does not store any PII in them. <br></br>
You may receive emails from us about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, flight specials, trip information, or other travel opportunities with AXIS Travel. To assess the
effectiveness of these emails, we may attach a web beacon that provides confirmation when you open an email from axistravel.com. This only occurs if your computer supports such
technology. AXIS Travel also collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to axistravel.com. This information is collected from
your computer's web browser to enhance your experience on our Web site and may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or
Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer website. In addition, authorized AXIS Travel personnel may update your profile to accurately reflect any new profile information
included in communications received from you.</p>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">NOTE ABOUT PHISHING SCAMS</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">Please send us any scam/phishing emails you have received by reporting them here ops@axistravel.com. <br></br>
If you have received an email that you believe to be a phishing scam please remember that it is very common for these scams to be redistributed at a later date with only slightly different
content, such as a different subject or return address, or with the fake webpage(s) hosted on a different webserver.<br></br>
We aim to report every variant of the scams we receive, so even if it appears that a scam you receive has already been reported, please submit it to us anyway. We submit and track all
reports against phishing with IC3 at www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx.</p>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WITH WHOM IT IS SHARED</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">When you make travel arrangements with AXIS Travel and you provide information about yourself, we use this information to complete your order (i.e., to complete air, hotel, car, and
other reservations), fulfill any customer service requests, and provide promotional or trip related information via email or direct mail. We do not share this information with outside parties
except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfill your travel arrangements. Such other parties may include, but are not limited to, appropriate airlines and other travel
suppliers, credit card merchant services, airline reservation systems, and other global distribution systems.<br></br>
These service providers will disclose information about your traveler profile to hotel, airline, cruise, rental car, and other travel suppliers whose products you have purchased. Although
AXIS Travel attempts to select travel suppliers that are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your
permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the information privacy practices of any travel suppliers whose products you purchase on axistravel.com. In addition, these travel
suppliers may also contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about your confirmed reservation.<br></br>
In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, AXIS Travel may use certain data for administrative and analytical purposes such as
information systems management, accounting, billing and audits. We may also use PII to provide you other services, such as sending you an email notification regarding the status of
your travel plans or informing you about special promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, flight specials, trip information, or other travel opportunities from AXIS Travel or its
marketing partners.<br></br>
Although no PII is collected, we monitor usersâ€™ navigation of our Web site in order to better understand and serve our customers. We may provide anonymous statistical information
based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the
number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their Web sites.
When you are on the Web site and are asked for PII, you are sharing that information with AXIS Travel and it will not be shared with third parties, except as set forth elsewhere in this
privacy policy.<br></br>
We may collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through sweepstakes, raffles, and promotions. We will share PII that is necessary for
these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This policy will not cover the use of your PII by these other companies. We encourage you to read a
company's privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services.
AXIS Travel may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or
entities that may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it.</p>

                <h5 className="font-weight-bold terms-head">Security of Your Personal Information</h5>
                <p className="terms-note">We recognize the importance of security for all PII associated with our customers and use reasonable measures consistent with industry practices to protect PII under our control.
However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we will use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In order to protect the information stored in our systems, we have implemented security measures, including data
encryption technology and firewalls.</p>

                <p className="terms-note">The Web site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over whom we have no control. The information practices of those Web sites are not covered by this
privacy policy. Any information you provide to third-party Web sites or that we provide in relation to travel reservations you made will be governed under the terms of each such Web
site's privacy policy. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site, and we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content,
actions, or policies of such third-party Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third-party Web sites that link to the Web site, because such privacy policies may
be materially different from this privacy policy.<br></br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone
